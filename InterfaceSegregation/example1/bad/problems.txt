The problems and the pitfalls
=============================

1. Recompiling the entire code even when a minor change has to be made

Even if you make a small modification, the entire code needs to be re-compiled
wasting precious development time.

2. What happens when you supply this to a client who is interested only in printing job?

You are passing a DLL or a library which contains a bunch of unnecessary functions which
are not all required to your client. He or she may get confused over these functions.
Passing a printer function to a printer client makes sense. But, what good does it make
passing a bunch of irrelevant functions?

3. Problem with “fat” Interfaces

Even though the Print functionality is the only needed function for the printer-client,
he/she might end up implementing some bunch of unwanted functions. Why are you forcing
your printer client to implement scanning functionality even when they don't want it?
